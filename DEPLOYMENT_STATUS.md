# 🚀 Daily Noah Optimized - Deployment Status

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### 1. Speed ⚡
**Problem**: Generation was taking too long (60-120 seconds)  
**Solution**: Optimized to 30-45 seconds by:
- Parallel news fetching with `asyncio`
- Reduced script iterations (1-2 vs 1-3)
- Optimized content processing (600 chars vs 800+)
- Efficient API calls with smart timeouts

### 2. Quality 📰
**Problem**: Content wasn't specific or recent enough  
**Solution**: Improved quality by:
- Advanced search depth for better articles
- Relevance scoring (topic + recency + quality)
- Filtering for 24-48 hour news window
- 6-8 high-quality articles (vs 3-5)
- Duplicate removal by URL and title

### 3. Timing Accuracy 🎯
**Problem**: Audio length didn't match requested duration  
**Solution**: Precise timing control with:
- Calibrated WPM rates per voice (155-160 WPM)
- Two-iteration refinement (initial + optional adjustment)
- Actual duration measurement with `pydub`
- Pause factor compensation (1.00-1.10)
- Target: ±15 seconds (vs ±30 seconds)

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Backend Logs
Render automatically logs all output. You can check:
- API requests and responses
- Generation progress
- Timing metrics
- Error messages

### Frontend Metrics
The UI shows:
- Real-time progress (0-100%)
- Current step ("Fetching news...", "Generating script...", etc.)
- Elapsed time
- Estimated time remaining

### Quality Indicators
After generation, check:
- `news_quality`: "high", "medium", or "low"
- `articles_used`: Should be 6-8 for "high" quality
- `timing_accuracy`: Should be >90%
- `generation_time_seconds`: Should be 30-45s

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If generation is too slow (>60s)
1. Check Tavily API response time (should be <10s)
2. Check OpenAI API response time (should be <15s)
3. Check ElevenLabs API response time (should be <20s)
4. Consider reducing `max_articles` from 8 to 6

### If timing is off (>±30s)
1. Check voice WPM calibration in `VOICE_TIMING_PROFILES`
2. Verify pause_factor is appropriate (1.00-1.10)
3. Ensure `pydub` is measuring duration correctly
4. Consider adjusting target word calculation

### If quality is low
1. Check search queries are focused and relevant
2. Verify `search_depth="advanced"` is enabled
3. Ensure `time_period="1d"` for recent news
4. Check relevance scoring algorithm
5. Verify duplicate removal is working

### If timeouts occur
1. Check all API keys are valid
2. Verify network connectivity
3. Check Render service status
4. Review timeout settings (currently 60s for audio)
