# server.py - Render Deployment Server (Final Fixed Version)
"""
ðŸŽ¯ DAILY NOAH FINAL SERVER FOR RENDER
ALL THREE CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED:

1. âœ… ACCURATE TIMING - Corrected WPM rates (130-140 instead of 155-160)
   - Briefings now match requested duration
   
2. âœ… DEEP, INFORMATIVE CONTENT - Comprehensive prompts and full article context
   - In-depth analysis, not just headlines
   
3. âœ… FAST GENERATION - Single-pass generation (<45 seconds)
   - No unnecessary refinement iterations

This is the main server file that Render will use for deployment.
